            <p class="text-small">Education is commonly subdivided into different types. The most common subdivision is
                between formal, non-formal, and informal education.[35][36][7][37] However, some theorists only
                distinguish between formal and informal education.[38] A process of teaching constitutes formal
                education if it happens in a complex institutionalized framework. Such frameworks are usually
                chronologically and hierarchically organized as in modern schooling systems, which have different
                classes based on the student's age and progress, all the way from primary school to university. Because
                of its scale, formal education is usually controlled and guided by a governmental entity and is normally
                compulsory up to a certain age.[35][39] Non-formal and informal education differ from formal education
                due to their lack of such a governmental institutionalized framework. Non-formal education constitutes a
                middle ground in the sense that it is also organized, systematic, and carried out with a clear purpose
                in mind, such as tutoring, fitness classes, or the scouting movement.[35][39][7] Informal education, on
                the other hand, happens in an unsystematic way through daily experiences and exposure to the
                environment.[</p>

            <p class="text-big">Transfering Education in India</p>
            <p class="text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as
                transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development
                of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical
                thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education
                results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In
                a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this
                process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and
                complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="text-small">Numerous definitions of education have been suggested by theorists belonging to
                diverse fields.[6][7][8] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving
                certain aims, especially the transmission of knowledge.[9] But they often include other aims as well,
                such as fostering skills and character traits.[9][6][10] However, there are deep disagreements about the
                exact nature of education besides these general characteristics. According to some conceptions, it is
                primarily a process that occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and learning.[11][12][7] Others
                understand it not as a process but as the achievement or product brought about by this process. On this
                view, education is what educated persons have, i.e. the mental states and dispositions that are
                characteristic of them.[11][12][7] However, the term may also refer to the academic study of the methods
                and processes taking place during teaching and learning, as well as the social institutions involved in
                these processes.[12] Etymologically, the word "education" is derived from the Latin word ēducātiō ("A
                breeding, a bringing up, a rearing") from ēducō ("I educate, I train") which is related to the homonym
                ēdūcō ("I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect") from ē- ("from, out of") and dūcō ("I lead, I
                conduct").</p>
